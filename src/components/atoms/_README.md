# Atoms Components Directory

This folder is reserved for simple, reusable atomic components only.

Components created here should be minimal, stateless, and focused on a single responsibility (e.g., Button, Input, Label).

These `atoms` components can be composed together to build more complex UI elements in the `molecules` or even
`organisms` directory in the project.
